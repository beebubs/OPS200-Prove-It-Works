In this project, used previous code from Mortgage Calculator project and added Unit/Integration tests.

Building a mini version of Mortgage Calculator.

Writing Unit tests in the beginning.

Writing End-to-End tests toward the end.

Adding a README.md document.

Pushing a branch with latest code up to GitHub.
